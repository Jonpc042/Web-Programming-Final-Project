                <p> In the workspace there may be issues with other employees or work-related matters that need to be handled in a specific manner.</p>
                <p> This page is a good starter if you're experiencing these issues such as any form of harassment or negligence in the workspace.</p>
                <p> On the left-side column please navigate to the page you feel best suits you. Feel free to contact us for further questions or concerns.</p>
                <p> Remember the intent of this program is to benefit the employee and the company, so do not feel embarrassed for contacting HR.</p>

                <p> Corrective action is a program that aims to guide an employee toward better performance or behavior by identifying the problems.</p>
                <p> A large part of corrective action is focused on finding the solution and to better the employee rather than punish.</p>
                <p> If there isn't improvement, or the issues continue to occur then more serious action might take place.</p>
                <p> This could range from an oral warning to the potential dismissal or demotion of an employee depending on the severity of the issue.</p>
